FBI Gun and census data are two independent table. Their common variables/value include state of United States and year month, which requires data cleaning at first. I joined these two dataset to see the relationship between gun purchase and census variable.

### Questions to answer:

#### 1. What census data is most associated with high gun registration?

#### 2. Is there a correlation between ethnic group proportion and gun registration?

#### 3. Is there a seasonal pattern for firearm shopping?
